Hi, Iâ€™m Carson Connard, a 3rd year undergraduate student at Kansas State University pursuing a degree in mathematics. I will be applying to graduate programs for pure mathematics over the coming year.

My research has been wholly in the spectral theory of operators, and generally speaking, my mathematical interests are in the field of analysis. More recently, I have also been reading some fundamental texts in differential geometry, to much interest.

This year, I have been fortunate enough to be able to take a first-year Ph.D. course load, including a graduate algebra sequence, introductions to point-set, algebraic, and differential topology, measure and integration theory, complex analysis, and differential geometry. I also participated in a directed reading project introducing homological algebra (i.e. additive and abelian categories) with a graduate student and a peer.
